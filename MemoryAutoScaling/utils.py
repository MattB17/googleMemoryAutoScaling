    Setup involves formatting x axis labels, adding a title and axis labels,

    time_points: int
        An integer representing the number of time points captured in the
        traces that are being plotted.
    tick_interval: int
        An integer representing the interval to display x axis labels. That is,

    title: str
        A string representing the plot title.
